# FirebaseAngularjsAuth
Firebase Authentication with AngularJs


Firebase is document database that provides real time update to all clients connected to it.

In addition to providing a persistence layer, Firebase also makes it easy to perform authentication against third party OAuth providers such as Google+, Facebook and Github. 

In many cases, in addition to authentication, an application will also require hooks into routing, protecting private pages and a means to store user profile information. 

This project illustrates:
* Use of Firebase authentication
* Hooking ui-router for public and authenticated access
* Retrieve and persist user profile information within Firebase
* Secure user profile information within Firebase
